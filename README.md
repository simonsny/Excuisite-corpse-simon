## Simon in Wonderland
Oh boy, Simon went down the **rabbit hole** and was lost.
He found a map that was gifted by Becode and finally got out.
Now he is looking for some friends.

The map first brings him to a place called “_Discord_”.
I think I already heard about that, Simon thinks to himself.
Maybe I will visit it someday.


The quest to find friends leads simon to table 4. 
Whilst in table 4, Simon discovers several friends through shared challenges!
These challenges are emerging from the operation Github.

Mo visits the map of simon
he thinks it is going to be a nice collaboration 
mo and simon could learn toghether how to code
